    "    - *Branch* Nodes are in the middle and have both incoming and outgoing edges. \n",
    "    - Nodes having an outgoing edge are called *parents* while those with incoming are called *children*. Nodes with same parents are called *siblings*.\n",
    "    - A **subtree** is a samller tree held within a larger tree.\n",
    "    - The **size** of a tree is based on the number of nodes.\n",
    "    - The **depth** of a node is the number of edges below the root node. The root node node has a depth of zero while its child one and so on.\n",
    "    - The **height** of a node is the number of edges above the furthest leaf node."
